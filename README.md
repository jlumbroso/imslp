ðŸŽ¼ The clean and modern way of accessing IMSLP data and scores programmatically. ðŸŽ¶

## Installation

The package is available on PyPi and can be installed using your favorite package
manager:

```shell
pip install imslp
```

## Data Sources

This project attempts to use robust sources of data, that do not require web scraping of some sort:

- **MediaWiki API.** IMSLP is [one of tens of thousands of websites](https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/IMSLP)
built on top of [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), the framework created for
[Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki). As such, it can be accessed through
the [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) for which, fortunately,
there exists a fantastic Python wrapper library called [`mwclient`](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient).

- **IMSLP API.** For convenience, the IMSLP built some *ad-hoc* scripts that can be used to get a
list of people and a list of works, in a variety of different formats, including JSON.

It also uses scraping to collect additional information (such as the number of pages in a score, the
number of times a score was downloaded, or the user-provided ratings).

### Some quirks of IMSLP

While fortunately, as mentioned, IMSLP uses a widely used open-source Wiki platform, MediaWiki, it has a
handful of quirks. Such as:

- Composers are stored as `Category`, for instance `Category:Scarlatti, Domenico`. For each composer,
there is usually three tabs: "Compositions", "Collaborations" and "Collections"; these are stored as
separate categories resulting from the concatenation of the composer and subtype, such as
`Category:Scarlatti, Domenico/Collections`.

- PDF files for sheet music are stored as "images"; unfortunately, for the time being, the scheme does
not appear in the URLs computed for the files. These need to be manually patched.

- The `imslpdisclaimeraccepted` cookie must be set to `"yes"` for files to download properly (otherwise,
downloading any file will result in the disclaimer page). With `mwclient`, this can be specified on login.
    ```python
    cookies = {
        "imslp_wikiLanguageSelectorLanguage": "en",
        "imslpdisclaimeraccepted": "yes",
    }
    ```

- Much of the metadata associated with images, such as the internal ID or the download counter, is stored
separately than the MediaWiki metadata. This makes scraping the rendered HTML page a necessary endeavour.

Fortunately all these quirks are handled by this package!

## Related Projects

Here are a handful of other related projects available on GitHub to access the IMSLP data programmatically:

- [jjjake/imslp-scrape](https://github.com/): Last commit in May 2012 (32 commits), mix of Python and shell, scraping
the website for data (people, score links) with HTML parsing.

- [FrankTheCodeMonkey/IMSLP-Scraper](https://github.com/FrankTheCodeMonkey/IMSLP-Scraper): Last commit in June 2020 
(6 commits), Python, scraping the website for data and scores, with HTML parsing and Selenium.

- [josefleventon/imslp-api](https://github.com/josefleventon/imslp-api): Last commit in May 2020 (17 commits),
JavaScript, uses [IMSLP's custom API](https://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:API) to get the list of people and list of works
programmatically through a web API query. 

More recently, and in other languages:

- [IMSLP Instrument Information Parsing Program](https://github.com/yoonlight/imslp): Last commit in July 2020
(47 commits), uses scraping to extract instrumentation information.
