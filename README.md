# imslp

ðŸŽ¼ The clean and modern way of accessing IMSLP data and scores programmatically. ðŸŽ¶

## Installation

The package is available on PyPi and can be installed using your favorite package
manager:

```shell
pip install imslp
```

## Data Sources

This project attempts to use robust sources of data, that do not require web scraping of some sort:

- **MediaWiki API.** IMSLP is [one of tens of thousands of websites](https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/IMSLP)
built on top of [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), the framework created for
[Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki). As such, it can be accessed through
the [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) for which, fortunately,
there exists a fantastic Python wrapper library called [`mwclient`](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient).

- **IMSLP API.** For convenience, the IMSLP built some *ad-hoc* scripts that can be used to get a
list of people and a list of works, in a variety of different formats, including JSON.

- [josefleventon/imslp-api](https://github.com/josefleventon/imslp-api): Last commit in May 2020 (17 commits),
JavaScript, uses [IMSLP's custom API](https://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:API) to get the list of people and list of works
programmatically through a web API query.

Let's be clear that all the heavy lifting is done by [`mwclient`](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient)â€”and
the volunteers who uploaded and/or scanned and/or typeset the scores on IMSLP.
